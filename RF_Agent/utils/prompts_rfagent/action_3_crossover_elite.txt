I have {nums} existing reward functions with their design ideas and codes as follows.
Additionally, we trained RL policy using the provided reward function code respectively and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every {epoch_freq} epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered.

Analysis tips for trained results:
{trained_result_analysis_tip}

Please create a new reward function inspired by those reward functions. Try to list the common ideas in those high score reward functions and combine high-performing reward components from different reward functions based on the data tracked. The new reward function should have a higher task score.
